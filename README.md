## üîç Key Observations from Machine Learning Models

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**:
- Both Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM struggled to detect anomalies.
- **AUC Scores**:
  - Isolation Forest: **0.4980**
  - One-Class SVM: **0.4871**
- This indicates weak anomaly patterns in the sampled dataset.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Supervised Attack Classification**:
- **Random Forest Performance**:
  - **AUC**: **0.6864**
  - Precision and Recall for the attack class (label `1`) were relatively low, suggesting label imbalance.
  - Precision (Attack): **0.48**, Recall (Attack): **0.41**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Time-Series Modeling**:
- The LSTM model performed well on sequence-based data:
  - **Training Accuracy**: ~91.50%
  - **Validation Accuracy**: ~92.30% (after 5 epochs).

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Investigate dataset for stronger anomaly patterns or feature engineering.
- Address class imbalance using techniques like **SMOTE** for oversampling.
- Explore more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Transformer-based models).


## üöÄ Step 5: Data Segmentation & Attack Characterization

- **Segments created**: 199.
- Segmented data saved to: `/reports/segmented_data.npy`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Techniques
